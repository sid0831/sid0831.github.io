# You've reached an engineer's home network

You have reached a landing page of a home network that you might have seen somewhere around you.

This home network belongs to Sidney Jeong, a technical consultant / system administrator based in Seoul, Republic of Korea (South).  
I'm a neurodivergent demiflux person who tries to be kind, bright and fun! I don't bite (unless you ask me to and I'm keen to), so feel free to ask me for a chat.

Unfortunately, you can't access this network from outside via plain http/s (well, without breaking in and also breaking law); You can browse these pages instead always.
