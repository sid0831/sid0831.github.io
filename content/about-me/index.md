## Who is this weirdo?

My name is Sidney Jeong (I do have a native name in Korean but [I don't really like it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming)), a [neurodivergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity) [amab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_assignment) "genderfluid in principle, demiboy in practice" [non-binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/Non-binary_gender) person based in [Seoul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul), [Republic of Korea (South)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea). My pronouns are they/them but he/him is acceptable for me.

I am very much a weird nerd, who tries to be considerate, kind, bright, and fun (and yes, I might freak you out). I do not bite unless you ask to do so and if and only if I'm keen on it, so feel free to reach out to me if you have something to tell me.

I used to study sociology in university and grad school. But I has always been interested in tech. After becoming unable to continue my study owing to financial challenges (and tbf the grad school life was not for me) and a lot of trial and error, I decided to start a career in tech. And I'd say I'm satisfied with it so far.

I am also a great fan of [Dreamcatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcatcher_(group)), a K-Pop girl group. Maybe we can talk about them when we have chance!
