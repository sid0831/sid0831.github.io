## Who is this weirdo?

My name is Sidney Jeong (I do have a native name in Korean but [I don't really like it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming)), a [neurodivergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity) amab "genderfluid in principle, demiboy in practice" [non-binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/Non-binary_gender) person based in [Seoul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul), [Republic of Korea (South)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea). My pronouns are they/them but he/him is acceptable for me.

I am very much a weird nerd, who tries to be considerate, kind, bright, and fun (and yes, I might freak you out). I do not bite unless you ask to do so and I'm keen to, so feel free to reach out to me if you have something to tell me.

I used to study sociology in university and grad school. But I has always been interested in tech. After being unable to continue my study owing to financial challenges, I decided to start a career in IT. And I'd say I'm satisfied with it so far.

I am also a great fan of [Dreamcatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcatcher_(group)), a K-Pop girl group. Maybe we can talk about them when we have chance!
