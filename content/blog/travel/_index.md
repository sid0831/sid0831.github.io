Some people often consider thinking an energy-inefficient thing. Since the human brain is not particularly an energy-optimised processor, it might be true. But that is also what made humanity develop (and proceed to endanger themselves and other species altogether) this further.

But what is the point of thinking if we don't remember it?

This category is just pastebin for my random thoughts.
