    <h3>Home network probably providing internet access for the laptop <a href="https://yoohyeon.sidlibrary.org/" title="or yoohyeon.sidlibrary.org">yoohyeon.dc.sidlibrary.org</a></h3>
    <p>You have reached a landing page of a home network that you might have seen somewhere around you. This home network belongs to Sidney Jeong, a technical consultant / system administrator based in Seoul, Republic of Korea (South). I'm a neurodivergent
        demiflux person who tries to be kind, bright and fun! I don't bite (unless you ask me to and I'm keen to), so feel free to ask me for a chat.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, you can&#39;t access this network from outside via plain http/s (well, without breaking in and also breaking law); You can browse these pages instead always.</p>
